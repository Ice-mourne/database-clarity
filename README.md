- Do not modify the contents of our database on Your end without clearly marking Your changes. This is necessary to avoid data inaccuracies.

- Want to use our data but in a different format such as Markdown? As long as you can provide us with the code that converts it from our existing formats to Yours, we can implement it into the database saving you runtime by omitting the conversion.
